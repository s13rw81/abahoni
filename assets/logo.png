# Placeholder for logo.png
# Replace this file with your actual logo image
# Recommended size: 200x60px (or similar aspect ratio)
# Supported formats: PNG, SVG, JPG
# 
# This is a placeholder file. In a real scenario, you would replace this
# with an actual image file. For GitHub Pages deployment, you can:
# 1. Upload your logo.png file directly to the assets/ folder
# 2. Or use a text-based logo by removing the <img> tag in index.html
#    and using the .logo-text span instead
